Our paper is accepted to IROS 2020 and is now available on Arxiv:  
[A decentralized framework for simultaneous calibration, localization and mapping with multiple LiDARs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01483)

**Notice**: Our code will be released before 30 November 2020 since I have a busy time schedule in these months.

# Introduction
**Decentralized_loam** is the code implementation of our paper "A decentralized framework for simultaneous calibration, localization and mapping with multiple LiDARs", which is developed based on our previous work [Loam-livox](https://github.com/hku-mars/loam_livox). Our project fuses data from multiple LiDARs in a decentralized framework, which can not only address the problem of localization and mapping, but can also online calibrate the extrinsic of 6-DoF (includes 3-DoF of rotation and 3-DoF of translation).
